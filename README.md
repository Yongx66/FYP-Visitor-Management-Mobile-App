The app is a mobile-based visitor management system that allows visitors to easily check in and check out. It is designed for buildings with high visitor traffic, where many people enter and exit daily. The app aims to improve the efficiency and security of the visitor management process. It works by allowing visitors to check in using their phones. Visitors can pre-register their visit through the app, create an account, and provide details such as their name, phone number, email address, and reason for visiting. Once a visitor has successfully registered, they will receive a digital visitor pass with a QR code, which they can use to gain access to the building upon arrival.
